# Todd Graham's Personal Site

This repository contains the source code for my personal site. It was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. I relied heavily on Bootstrap for styling to streamline the website. No frameworks were used so the navbar and footer were copied and pasted between files. This was created as my final project for Introduction to Web Development during the Summer of 2021 while attending Portland State University.

The site is currently deployed [here](https://toddgraham121.github.io/) using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To run the code locally, please right click `index.html` and open using your installed internet browser.
